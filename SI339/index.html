        <p>This is Sammy Edward Ashworth, he is a dachshund. 
            Sammy was born on June 13, 2009, making him 14 years old. 
            Sammy is very protective of his house, and has quite the 
            bark despite his small frame.However, Sammy will always try 
            to sneak in a kiss if you're sitting next to him, or lean 
            his back against you for scratches and cuddles. </p>

        <p>Sammy loves spending time with his owners, chasing chipmunks, 
            car rides (with a stop at starbucks for a puppuccino), lounging 
            in the sun, and sleeping in bed. Sammy loves attention, he does 
            not like when his family directs their attention to other animals 
            or even babies. Surprisingly, he loves interacting with cats but
            not other dogs. Sammy can stand on his hind legs, and will always 
            greet you at the door when you arrive home. The Ashworth family 
            would not be the same without Sammy, making him everyone's 
            favourite Ashworth.</p>
